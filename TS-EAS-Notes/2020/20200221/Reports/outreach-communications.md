# Scope and role of the Outreach and Communications team
The scope/role of this team represents a refactored charge for the former Documentation team. The focus of the Outreach and Communications team is to promote broader awareness of TS-EAS’ activities and its work plans, across a range of key stakeholders and audiences.

In addition to coordinating closely with other TS-EAS teams, the Outreach and Communications team would liaise with the Encoded Archival Standards (EAS) Section leadership on communications, education, and outreach plans.

# Work completed between August 2019-February 2020

* With TS-EAS, we formalized the charge for the Outreach and Communications team, launched the group, and confirmed the team membership.
* Established team workspace and communications channel (Google Group list, Slack)
* Hosted initial planning meeting in January; scheduled monthly meetings
* Began to scope a draft statement for posting to the EAD and EAC-CPF websites regarding translated tag libraries and application guidelines
* Started on work to host an initial, pilot webinar in April. The webinar will highlight TS-EAS' workplan and priorities for 2020. We'll plan to host 2 sessions -- one optimized for US timezones, one optimized for Europe timezones. Each session would be ~30 mins. (15 min. Presentation, 15 min. Q&A). 
* Prior to April, we will conduct early testing of SAA's Zoom to ensure that it'll work for our purposes -- and will create a checklist of pre- and post-webinar steps. 
Following on the webinar, we will prepare a write-up of TS-EAS' workplan and priorities for the year -- and distribute that message through key channels (e.g., EAS Section, EAD listserv, and other venues)
