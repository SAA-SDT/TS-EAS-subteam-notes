        * Annual meeting for TS-EAS 2026 will be on-line before the SAA annual meeting
    * Submission package
        * First draft of the submission packet will be sent to the Standards Committee by October 17th. 
        * A copy of the submission package was sent to all TS-EAS team leads for their review, their comments were integrated into the final submission package
        * We took a slightly different approach to the document.
        * Layout and language. We used less technical language in order to make the document easier to understand.
        * Reusing our small working groups result in August 
        * We are using appendices to make the document more concise. Currently the submission package is approximately 20-22 pages.
        * As far as what a submission package should look like,we did maintain the same themes provided by SAA. We just modified the language accordingly.
        * After the submission package has been approved, we can focus on outreach and how we would like TS-EAS to move forward.
        * Tag Library & Schema
        * Other helpful document
        * Final draft of the submission packet will be sent to the SAA Council by the Standards Committee in time for their February 17-19, 2026 meeting.
    * Examples
        * Tag Library examples
            * Examples in the Tag library used to be provided as snippets. We would like to provide examples with more context which align more closely with the Best Practice Guidelines. 
            * Moving from element-based and attribute-based examples to encoding examples per section within the EAS structure, i.e. &lt;control>, identity section (&lt;identificationData> in EAD), description section (entity and narrative elements in EAD), &lt;relations>
            * These will be included in the Tag Libraries as an annex with references from the individual elements and attributes
            * Aim to have a core version (e.g. only mandatory elements, only essential attributes) and an extended version per example 
            * Aim at using the same examples across all EAS when it comes to shared elements and attributes
        * Best Practices Guide Examples
            * Keeping the approach of providing element and attribute encoding examples in context, illustrating potential alternative encoding approaches as applicable
            * Could be extended by encoding examples provided by the community (which would be marked as such for provenance transparency)
    * GitHub
        * TS-EAS has created different teams in GitHub
            * EAC-CPF
            * EAC-F
            * EAD
            * Outreach
            * Schema
            * TS-EAS Alumni 
* Any other business (time permitting)
* Next meeting
    * February 2026 18th & 19th

      

Mary & Karin would like to thank everyone in TS-EAS for their hard work on the submission package. Each of you have contributed significantly to its culmination.
