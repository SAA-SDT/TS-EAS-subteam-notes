To get started, rather than creating an EAD 4.0 file from scratch, we suggest that you copy one of the EAD 4.0 test files in this folder here, which are pre-associated with both the draft schema and schematron:

- ead4-draft0.2-starter-file_simple.xml: This file only includes the mandatory elements to form a valid EAD 4.0 file (and - apart from the schema location etc. attributes in `<ead>` itself - no attributes).
- ead4-draft0.2-starter-file_extended.xml: This file includes some more elements in `<control>` and in `<archDesc>` as well as a skeleton structure with `<descriptionOfComponents>` and unnumbered `<c>` elements; this version also includes some attributes for illustration.
