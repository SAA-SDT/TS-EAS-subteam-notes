## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Complexity
    * Looking at what we said last time, we agree upon having the one description per file and connection them through relations
    * We gain simplicity, possibility to start with just a function and then do activities, a way of being able to have central descriptions of functions/activities that can be linked to
    * Karin will make a new version of our all elements and attributes file with the complexity removed
        * Some changes to the TL with removal of some element is needed.
* The examples
    * We need to make a new example, fuller.
    * Can we find a university example?
    * Kolbe to look into this.
* TL
    * All our files available here: [https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/tree/ead4](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/tree/ead4)
