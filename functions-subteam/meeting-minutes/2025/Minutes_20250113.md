## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
    * No comments on the proposed timeline so it is the one we will be using! 
* Draft EAC-F TL
    * Ailie has created a draft version of the TL. We are doing a lot of reuse so there are not many specific functions element to write text for.
        * We need to think about some of our elements since they have the same name as EAC-CPF elements but are not the same.
            * Examples includes, description and identity
        * [https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/wiki/Design-Principles](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/wiki/Design-Principles) 
    * We will need to create the introduction texts and so on
        * Will be possible to reuse text from the White Paper
            * [https://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/White%20paper%20--%20A%20proposal%20for%20encoding%20functions.pdf](https://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/White%20paper%20--%20A%20proposal%20for%20encoding%20functions.pdf)

* Discussion

        * Rename and nest Functions?
        * How to think about attributes?
        * How is is the different options to implement? Might be easier with one filer per activity/function?
