## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Complexity
    * The question is if we should have the possibility to choose if its one function/activity per file or if it is possible to describe it all in one file
        * Thinking about a lot of possibilities, simple solution means the forms in software doesn't need to be over complex and hard to fill in
        * No choices is needed to be made
        * All described Functions/Activities will look the same
        * Looking forward no matter what we want to be possible is to be able to be aligned with different models and having one function/activity per file will be aiding that
* More discussion
    * Describing relations that functions can have with other entities is needed
        * Textual description needed in preface
        * Element descriptions needed to cover it in more specific rulelike way
    * Time of our meeting
        * We need to start at 2.30 CET going forward, is it possible??
    * We need to get a complete understanding on which of the shared elements we need to talk more about so we ensure that they are shared elements or get renamed.
