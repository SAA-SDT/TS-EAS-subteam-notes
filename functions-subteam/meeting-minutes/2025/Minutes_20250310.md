## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* The examples
    * Kolbe have meetings on campus tp get input during this week and will report back via email and on the next meeting
* Creation of TL and Schema
    * Shared elements
        * All elements which we should especially look at was divided to the team
            * We went through the result
            * Most are ok without any changes
            * Some elements will need examples being more functionslike
            * Some elements might need changes when we look at the functions specific elements
            * Questions raised during the work
                * Is &lt;function> going to be deprecated in EAD now that we have EAF?  If not, we should check to be sure the definition is clear as to when to use what.
                    * It will stay in both EAD and EAC-CPF so definitions and maybe even name will need to be discussed and suggestions made to the teams
                * Do we need a separate attribute list for the shared elements for EAF?
                    * That's the final goal. If we at first align with EAC-CPF that will give us an advantage
* Action points
    * All
        * Go through the allotted shared attributes which we should especially look at
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * 24th of March, 1.30pm CET (US already on summer time)
        * Dia talk through the shared elements looked at
        * Go through the shared attributes allotted to you
        * Examples, report from Kolbe
        * Look at Diaâ€™s summary and see if that one will be the basis for looking at the functions specific elements and attributes
