## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
    * Our goal is to have the elements and attributes ready by 9th of June both TL text and issues so the schema can be created. The editorial texts we can give some more time to create, the preface and afterword.
    * After a short discussion we will start to meet every week to make sure we have the TL entries ready by the 9th of June
* Creation of TL and Schema
    * Shared elements
        * Nothing new today
    * Shared attributes
        * Nothing new today

            * functionAgents

        * Today we looked at the elements Kolbe have made, some edits will be made
            * functionDates
            * functionHistory
        * Elizabeth will create the drafts for Dia’s elements
    * EAF attributes
        * There is only one specific EAF attribute
            * functionStatus Kolbe will do this one
* Discussion points
    * functions/function in EAD/EAC-CPF
        * Marie Elia and Karin have met and a draft has been presented to the EAC-CPF team, more discussion is needed before it will be also handed over to Kerstin and the EAD team. 
        * Current example in EAC-CPF is a descriptive text so investigations into its use is being made and a suggestion where function is instead pointed to via a relation
        * The option that EAF might be possible to be added through XML inclusion in an &lt;objectXMLWrap> is being looked at
    * The element description that is shared with EAC-CPF might need a name change, the use is the same but the elements within differ.
        * Short discussion gave that it is an element that gathers description elements so it should have the same name but not the same content.
    * Examples
        * The suggested examples are:
            * Government archives; possible examples:
                * American Revolution Bicentennial Administration
                * United States Agency for International Development
                * United States Department of State
                * Works Progress Administration
                * The United States Institute of Peace
            * University archives; possible examples:
                * Development of Alumni Affairs Committee
                * Buildings and Grounds Committee
                * Institutional Policies Committee
            * Discussion
                * United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is an example that a lot of people know about so it will be a good example.
                * Elizabeth will look into its changes in function in recent time
                * Two of the university examples will most likely be used
                * Kolbe will add short descriptions of the examples in these notes.
    * Element functionType needs a discussion, is it needed or not? Will be possible to discuss when the draft elements have been made.
* Action points
    * Creation of the last drafts
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * 19th of May, 2.30pm CEST
