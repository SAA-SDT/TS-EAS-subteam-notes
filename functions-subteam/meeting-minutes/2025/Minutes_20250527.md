## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Creation of TL and Schema
    * Shared elements
        * Nothing new today
    * Shared attributes
        * Nothing new today
    * EAF elements
        * Ready for going into the TL
            * functionAgent
            * functionAgents
            * functionDescription
            * functionsDescription	
            * functionDates
            * functionHistory
        * Elizabeth raised the question about the elements that still needed to be drafted, functionType, otherFunctionTypes and otherFunction
            * We have moved away from describing a hierarchy of functions in one file; this means that what these elements are used for will need to be expressed in the relation to the other description instead
            * We will not create these elements, instead we need to write an explanation!
    * EAF attributes
        * Kolbe have made the draft, some edits will be made
            * functionStatus
* Discussion points
    * Examples
        * We have chosen to use:
            * Government archives:
                * United States Agency for International Development
            * University archives:
                * Buildings and Grounds Committee
            * Discussion
                * We need to make sure to describe 3-4 function records per example.
                * Will be good to also have a simple EAC-CPF and EAD to relate to
* Action points
    * Karin: Put our drafts and shared elements and attributes into the XML format, that will happen tomorrow. When we have this it will be possible to get a draft PDF made :-)
        * Next step is to create issues for the Schema creation
    * Elizabeth; Will start with the governmental example
    * Kolbe: Will do the same for the university example 
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * 27th of May, 2.30pm CEST
